Ahh, classic networking headache 😅 You’re not crazy—this is a **very common** issue with video/network apps.

Short answer:
👉 It’s **most likely your application logic**, not the Wi-Fi itself (though Wi-Fi can *expose* the bug).

Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## What’s probably happening

Since it works fine **at first**, then dies after ~3 minutes, that screams one of these:

### 1️⃣ **Connection timeout / keep-alive issue (MOST COMMON)**

Many networks (routers, firewalls, NAT) will **close “idle” connections** after a few minutes.

If your app:

* Opens a socket (TCP/UDP/WebSocket)
* Streams video
* **Does NOT send keep-alive packets**

➡️ The router thinks: *“This connection is dead”* and drops it.

When you reconnect Wi-Fi, you force a new connection, so it works again.

✅ **Fix**

* Send **keep-alive / heartbeat packets** every 10–30 seconds
* Or enable TCP keep-alive if supported

Example idea:

```text
Client → Server: "ping"
Server → Client: "pong"
```

---

### 2️⃣ **You’re not handling disconnects properly**

The connection might drop, but:

* Your app **thinks it’s still connected**
* So it never reconnects automatically

Result:

* App frozen
* Only Wi-Fi reconnect fixes it

✅ **Fix**

* Detect broken connections
* Auto-reconnect in code

---

### 3️⃣ **Buffer or memory leak in your app**

After a few minutes:

* Video buffers fill up
* Memory grows
* App stops receiving data

This is common in:

* Custom video streaming
* Poor socket cleanup
* No flow control

✅ **Fix**

* Monitor RAM usage
* Clear buffers
* Use proper streaming protocols

---

### 4️⃣ **Router / NAT timeout (especially on Wi-Fi)**

Home routers often:

* Kill long-lived connections
* Especially UDP streams

Mobile hotspots are even worse.

✅ **Fix**

* Use keep-alives
* Use TCP if possible
* Or use a protocol designed for streaming

---

## How to tell if it’s Wi-Fi or your app

Try this quick test:

### ✅ Test A: Different network

* Try **mobile hotspot**
* Try **another Wi-Fi**

If it still dies after ~3 minutes → **100% app issue**

### ✅ Test B: Add logging

Log:

* When packets stop arriving
* When socket closes
* Any errors/exceptions

---

## Best practices for video over network

If you’re rolling your own solution:

* Use **RTSP / WebRTC / HLS / DASH**
* Implement **heartbeat**
* Handle reconnects automatically

If you tell me:

* Language (Java, Python, C++, JS, Android, iOS)
* Protocol (TCP, UDP, WebSocket)
* Server type

I can tell you **exactly** what line of logic is missing 👌
