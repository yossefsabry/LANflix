LANflix is a local media streaming app with two modes: Server and Client.
Run the server on one device to host a local media folder, and use the client
on another device to discover and stream videos over your LAN.

Features:
- Local-only streaming on your home network
- Automatic server discovery over Wi-Fi
- Resume playback with configurable history retention
- Media management dashboard
- ExoPlayer-based playback

No cloud accounts are required, and everything stays on your local network.
